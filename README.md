****Iris Flower Classification****

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify different species of the Iris flower. The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of data science and machine learning, making it ideal for beginners to get hands-on practice.

**Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements using different classification algorithms. The dataset consists of 150 samples with four features and three classes. The classification is done using features such as:

• Sepal Length

• Sepal Width

• Petal Length

• Petal Width

**Dataset Information**

The dataset contains the following species of Iris:

• Iris Setosa

• Iris Versicolor

• Iris Virginica

**Steps Involved in the Project**

• Data Exploration and Visualization: Understanding the dataset and visualizing the relationships between features using plots.

• Data Preprocessing: Checking for missing values, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

• Model Building: Applying machine learning algorithm:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

• Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models based on accuracy and classification report.

**Technologies Used**

Jupyter Notebook for coding and visualization.

Python programming language.

Pandas for data manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
